## Desert Collections

## Notes

1. How will I handle the actions in the folder structure.

   - Create action files at each route with "use server" at the top.
   - Within these I can place all db and form parsing actions for each form
   - [example](https://whateverittech.medium.com/handle-form-on-nextjs-14-using-server-action-and-drizzle-orm-de9c23826592)

2. How will I handle client side form validation with server actions
